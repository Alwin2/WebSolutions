<h2>What is a WLAN?</h2>
A wireless local-area network (LAN) uses radio waves to connect devices such as laptops to the Internet and to your business network and its applications. When you connect a laptop to a WiFi hotspot at a cafe, hotel, airport lounge, or other public place, you're connecting to that business's wireless network.



        <h2> How do they work? </h2>
          <p class="blog-content">Wireless networks use radio waves to connect devices such as laptops to the Internet, the business network and applications. When laptops are connected to Wi-Fi hot spots in public places, the connection is established to that business’s wireless network. There are four main types of wireless networks:
             <ol>
            <li>  Wireless Local Area Network (LAN): Links two or more devices using a wireless distribution method, providing a connection through access points to the wider Internet.</li>
</li>
            <li>  Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN): Connects several wireless LANs.
</li>
            <li>  Wireless Wide Area Network (WAN): Covers large areas such as neighboring towns and cities.
</li>

<li>Wireless Personal Area Network (PAN): Interconnects devices in a short span, generally within a person’s reach.
</li>
          </ol>

<h2>Router and Modem</h2>
<p class="blog-content"> The most essential elements of a Wireless Network are the Wireless Router and the modem. The Wireless Router creates a local area network and manages communication between all the networked devices. The modem connects to your Wireless router and provides your local area network(LAN) with access to the internet which is called Wide Area Network (WAN). To access the internet, You need an ISP in order to communicate manage communication between them, the router assigns each device a unique IP address. These addresses allow the router to know where to send the information. Wireless Router assigns the unique ip address to a device when the device connects to the network. An ip address consists of four number segments, separated by periods. The LAN is defined by the first 3 number segments and is shared by all connected devices, the last number is unique for every device. The router has a gateway address it comes preinstalled with your ISP.
