  <h2>What is Bluetooth?</h2>

  <img src=""img/bluetooth.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:304px;height:228px;">


  Bluetooth is a way of exchanging data wirelessly over short distances.

  Using a special radio frequency to transmit data, it creates a short range network. It is very secure and can connect up to eight devices (items of electronic equipment) at the same time. The chip can be plugged into items such as computers, digital cameras, mobile phones and faxes.

  Bluetooth is particularly convenient in certain situations for example, when transferring files from one mobile phone to another without cables. Sending music and photos between a PC and a mobile phone is another useful application of Bluetooth.

        <h2> How does bluetooth work?</h2>
          <p class="blog-content">
            Bluetooth sends and receives radio waves in a band of 79 different frequencies (channels) centered on 2.45 GHz, set apart from radio, television, and cellphones, and reserved for use by industrial, scientific, and medical gadgets. Bluetooth's short-range transmitters are one of its biggest advantages. They use virtually no power and, because they don't travel far, are  more secure than wireless networks that operate over longer ranges, such as Wi-Fi.

Bluetooth devices automatically detect and connect to one another and up to eight of them can communicate at any one time. They don't interfere with one another because each pair of devices uses a different one of the 79 available channels. If two devices want to talk, they pick a channel randomly and, if that's already taken, randomly switch to one of the others  To minimise the risks of interference from other electrical appliances pairs of devices constantly shift the frequency they're using—thousands of times a second.

<h2> Why is it called Bluetooth?</h2>
The name ’Bluetooth’ reflects the Scandinavian origins of the technology. It is named after a 10th century Danish viking, King Harald Blåtand (translates to 'Bluetooth' in English).

He united and controlled Denmark and Norway, hence the association of uniting devices through Bluetooth. Legend has it that he liked eating blueberries - so much that his teeth became stained with the colour of the fruit, giving rise to his name!
